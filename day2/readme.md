# ðŸ“Š Day 2: Advanced Manipulation & SQL Automation

On Day 2, I focused on transforming raw data into insights using Python and SQL.

### ðŸ”¹ What I Did:
- âœ… Used `groupby` and `pivot_table` to answer business-related questions like top categories, average price, etc.
- âœ… Automated SQL queries using `sqlite3` in Python to analyze customer churn data
- âœ… Practiced writing reusable, modular SQL analysis functions
- âœ… Output results into clean, query-ready dataframes

---
### ðŸ’» Tech Used:
- Python
- Pandas (groupby, pivot)
- SQLite + SQL in Python
- Jupyter Notebook

---
ðŸ“Œ This improved my ability to structure, filter, and aggregate data for reporting and decision-making.
