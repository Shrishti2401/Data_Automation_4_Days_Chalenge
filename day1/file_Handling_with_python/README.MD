# 📂 File Handling & Data Cleaning with Python
This mini-project is part of my Python Data Automation Challenge (Day 1). 
The goal is to automate data handling tasks commonly encountered in analytics workflows.

##📌 Project Overview
In this script, I used Python to:

-📥 Read data from an CSV file

-🧹 Handle missing data using various strategies

-✏️ Rename columns for better clarity

-🧼 Clean and preprocess the data using pandas
