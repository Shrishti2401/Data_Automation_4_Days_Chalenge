# 🐍 Day 1: Web Scraping & Data Cleaning

On Day 1 of the Data Automation Challenge, I focused on extracting raw product data from websites and preparing it for analysis.

### 🔹 What I Did:
- ✅ Web scraped structured product data (title, price, rating) using `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`
  
- ✅ Cleaned raw text data and handled missing or inconsistent fields

- ✅ Stored scraped data in a CSV format for later use
---
### 💻 Tech Used:
- Python
- BeautifulSoup4
- Pandas
- CSV file handling
---
📌 This laid the foundation for automating real-world data collection workflows.
