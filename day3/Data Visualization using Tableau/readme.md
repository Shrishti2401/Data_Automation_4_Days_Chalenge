# ðŸ“Š Day 3 â€“ Data Visualization Automation Challenge

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This dashboard project focuses on visualizing sales and customer insights using Tableau Public.
While full automation is still in progress,
I have started integrating Python to simulate dynamic data with real-time timestamps, which I plan to connect with Tableau in the next stage.

## âœ… Whatâ€™s Included
- Interactive Tableau Dashboard [sales_dashboard.twb](Interactive_Sales_And_Customer_Dashboard.twb)
- Python script to generate sample sales data with timestamp
- CSV output: `sales_data_cleaned.csv`
